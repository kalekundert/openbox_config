# Note: The XIM input method (which is apparently ancient) triggers bug #3664 
# in inkscape when the text tool is activated.  A workaround is to use the 
# 'gtk-in-context-simple' method for GTK, which makes an effort to read the 
# same `.Xcompose` file.  Longer term solutions might be to use a different 
# input method, e.g. `ibus` or `uim`, but I'm not sure if either of those 
# support the same succinct hotkeys I have.
